A most basic [Multilayer-Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) implemented in Rust, trained on a sine-wave. Likely due to an error in the implementation, the training runs quite poorly, but does converge eventually.

### Running
Install [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) and run:
```
cd rust-multilayer-perceptron
cargo run --release  # equivalent to `cargo r -r`
```
